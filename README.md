# Character information

* Authors: Cyrille Bougot
* NVDA compatibility: 2017.3 to 2019.2
* Download [stable version][1]
* Download [development version][2]

This addon allows to present in a message character information such as unicode name, number, category, etc.


## Commands

* Numpad2 (all keyboard layouts) or NVDA+. (laptop layout): when pressed 4 times, displays information about the character of the current navigator object where the review cursor is situated.


## Notes

* This addon provides also a script to display directly the review cursor character information. This script has no default gesture assigned. If you feel unconfortable with the four press gesture, you may assign to it a gesture in NVDA's input gesture dialog ("Text review" category).
* The provided information is in english since it is part of Unicode norm. If a local translation exists for this addon, the information is also provided alongside with english.
* The CLDR name (Unicode Common Locale Data Repository) is only supported with NVDA 2019.1 and above.
